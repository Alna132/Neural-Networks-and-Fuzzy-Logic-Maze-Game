# Neural-Networks-and-Fuzzy-Logic-Maze-Game
As part of our 4th Year Artificial Intelligence, we were tasked with creating a Maze Game which incorporates Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks in order to control randomly generated enemies.

## Project Outline:
You are required to create a simple maze-based game in which the characters are controlled by fuzzy logic or neural networks and incorporates a subset of the path finding algorithms covered in the Artificial Intelligence module.

## Game controls:
- Navigate with directional arrows.
- When next to an object, interact with it by walking into it.
- The S key displays player stats.
- The H key uses a health potion.
- The Z key toggles the zoom of the map.
- The Esc key quits the game.

### To do list:
- Add Neural Network to control spiders. (25%)
- Add fuzzy logic. (25%)
- Figure out AI Search Characters.(20%)
- Add ExecutorService, Thread pool to thread the caracters. (10%)
- Add strength and health points calculations to the fight interaction.
